# ColourGame
The Color Game is a fun Tkinter-based Python app where you type the color of the displayed text, not the word itself. Start by pressing Enter to begin a 30-second countdown, scoring points for correct answers. Use the "Reset Time" button to restart the timer and challenge yourself with this engaging test of speed and color recognition.
